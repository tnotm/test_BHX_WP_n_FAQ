Certificates for Deposit (CDs)  

$571 Billion in the USA , not including JUMBO or Foreign 

BitcoinHEX is the first high interest savings account on the Blockchain! 

There's more to finance than currency! At your normal bank these are called CDs or time deposits, but they don't pay better interest if less people use them, we do! Let's replace all these middlemen with trustless interest! BitcoinHEX is a Store of Value. 369%+ ROI if only 1% of coins stake. 

 

THE BEST THING A BLOCKCHAIN CAN DO IS STORE VALUE! 

Being a payment network is 10x less valuable. 

Gold=$7.7 Trillion Visa=$320 Billion MasterCard=$212 Billion PayPal=$101 Billion. 

Gold is 10x more valuable than those others combined! And no one uses it to pay for their coffee.

NEVER BEFORE SEEN FEATURES!    

BitcoinHEX is the first certificate of deposit on the blockchain. Trustless interest. Pays holders instead of miners. No Satoshi (if he doesn't claim in 50 weeks) or Mt.Gox dumping on you. No inflation bug possible like bitcoin has had. Unit bias fixed. Higher TPS. More distributed. Whale penalty which gives whales coins to stakers, etc. 

 

Dishonest stakers that end stake early or late pay honest stakers. Longer stake commit pays 20% more per year (partial years are fine). Open source. No premine, no ICO, lower fees, lower inflation. Referral program. Founder is a marketing expert with an audience. Early adopters get paid extremely well. 

 

20% Speed bonus falling to 0% over the fifty weeks. Unclaimed coins paid to stakers 2% per week for 50 weeks. Every week you donâ€™t claim, someone else gets your coins. Critical mass and Virality bonuses increase payouts to early stakers to cancel out desire to keep it a secret and get more unclaimed coins. Every pumpamental to lock up supply and increase price.  

 

The inflation is also delayed, because it's only paid on ended stakes, and stakes can last 50 years. No trading of staked coins to increase value of unstaked coins, and chance people early endstake and pay penalties to honest stakers. 

 

MOST OF THE MONEY IN CRYPTO IS MADE BY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GET A COIN. 

Bitcoin is 10 years old already. By the time you hear about a coin, it's already up 10x-1000x for the first in. It's easier to 100x from $10 than from $3000 

 

REWARDS 

Stakers earn more interest when less coins are staked. Stakers earn less interest when more coins are staked. More coins staked, means lower supply available on the market, which can mean higher price.

Staking 

If 1% of coins stake, they make 369% interest avg. e.g. If 2% then 184.5%, 10% is 36.9% The less stakers the less the pool gets divided. More stakers, less circulating supply

1/2 Late End Stake penalties paid to pool. (1% of stake per week after 2 week grace) 

LongerPaysBetter 

The longer you stake, the more you make. ~20% bonus shares every year you commit over 1 period. Works on any length over. So 5 years gets 2x shares that 1 period would  

Compounding 

The interest pool is compounded every period, maximizing your gains 

 

The war for longer stakes 

You know how you get more interest for staking longer? LongerPaysBetter also amplifies your other bonuses including the massive claim phase bonuses!  It's a war for longer lockups to get more bonus shares than everyone else! Those that believe in the project the most gain the most bonus shares. 

 

Example claim 

You claim 1 Bitcoin worth of BHX during the first week. 

You receive 10,000 BHX plus 2,000 early claim (speed bonus) = 12,000 BHX 
The person that referred you gets 20% = 2,400 BHX 

You stake for 52 periods (364 days) 

This gives you ~20% extra shares in the LoyalStaker share pool 

If only 1% of coins are staked, you get 369% APR plus the extra shares may put you over shorter stakers. As more coins get staked, your APR goes down. As more and larger claims are made it goes up.  

Your share of 2% of the unclaimed coins are credited to your stake every week until week 50.  You unstake. You now likely have several tens of thousands of BHX (multiplied your stack a few times) from being staked during all the bonuses. 

 

How to claim

Compressed summary for pasting 

BitcoinHEX: Claim free BHX by signing statement given by the claim tool from Bitcoin wallet containing BTC in addresses starting with 1 or BC1. All unclaimed coins distributed to staked claimants over 50 weeks. (GET SATOSHI'S COINS if he doesn't claim.) You're missing 2% more of your stack every week you delay claiming, till none left at 50 weeks. Pays holders instead of miners. Bonuses: refer:20% Speed: 20% falling to 0 at week 50. Up to 20% adoption bonuses, VIRALITY: the more people that claim, and CRITICAL MASS: the more coins claimed. Only referral and speed bonuses are paid to non-stakers.
